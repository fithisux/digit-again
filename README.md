# Digit again

This is an attempt to automatically generate an AST from amalgamated C header files following a restricted syntax.
The experiment at first targets DuckDB C-header file with code generation as an example for the D Programming language ( :heart: ).

It is a WIP. If successful I can try to extend so as to cover more cases.

Still, light modifications in the input header file are necessary.

Codeed in Python and included a number of tests.
